## 1. Overview

Smart Task Allocation is a multi-tenant SaaS web application that helps small and medium-sized businesses manage casual staff task allocation. The system centralizes task creation, staff eligibility checking, ranked staff suggestions, assignment, time tracking, notifications, and audit logging in one platform.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Businesses relying on casual/hourly staff often manage allocation through spreadsheets or messaging apps. This leads to missed eligibility checks, overlapping assignments, unclear accountability, and slow decision-making.

### 1.2 Solution

A web-based platform that:
- Checks staff eligibility (availability, certifications, hour limits, department scope) before assignment
- Provides AI-assisted ranked staff suggestions with clear explanations
- Supports manager-confirmed or auto-assignment workflows
- Records important actions in audit logs for accountability
- Enforces subscription-based member limits

### 1.3 Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | Description |
|---|---|
| Task-level allocation | Assigns staff to specific tasks (not just shifts) |
| Unified eligibility engine | Checks availability, certs, hours, overlaps, and dept scope together |
| Explainable suggestions | Shows ranked staff with clear reasons for each recommendation |
| Configurable enforcement | Supports strict blocks AND warning-based overrides with recorded reasons |
| Allocation auditability | Records assignments, overrides, cert decisions, clock adjustments |
| Department-scoped access | Clear role boundaries (Platform Admin → Company Admin → Manager → Staff) |

## 2. User Roles and Access

### 2.1 Role Hierarchy

| Track | Role | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Public | Unregistered User | Landing page, pricing, registration |
| Management | Platform Admin | Platform-wide tenant management |
| Management | Company Admin | Organization-wide (inherits Manager capabilities) |
| Management | Manager | Assigned department(s) within one organization |
| Workforce | Staff Member | Own profile, tasks, availability, certifications |

### 2.2 Role Rules

- Platform Admins manage tenants but do NOT participate in task allocation
- Company Admins have company-wide access and inherit Manager-level capabilities
- Managers access only tasks/staff/certs within their assigned department scope
- Staff Members can belong to multiple departments within the same organization
- Each organization operates as a separate tenant with isolated data
- Company Admins can invite users only within the subscription plan's member limit

### 2.3 Employment Types

Staff Members have an employment type that affects scheduling:
- **Casual** — default, flexible availability
- **Full-time** — standard schedule expectations

## 3. Subscription Plans

| Plan | Member Limit | Price (Monthly) | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Free | Up to 10 | $0 | Core features, 2 departments, 20 active tasks |
| Pro | Up to 50 | $29 | Custom roles, PDF export, mass import, 10 departments |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Contact us | Audit log, priority support, unlimited everything |

### 3.1 Stripe Integration (Sandbox/Test Mode)

- Stripe checkout for paid plan selection during registration
- Webhook handling for subscription lifecycle events
- Test mode only — no real payments processed
- Production billing (recurring billing, invoices, refunds, proration) is out of scope

## 7. Key Workflows

### 7.1 Registration Flow

1. View landing page → Select plan → Stripe checkout (paid plans)
2. Create account (name, email, password)
3. Register organization (name, industry, address, logo)
4. Verify email
5. Redirect to onboarding/dashboard

### 7.2 Task Allocation Flow

1. Manager creates task (title, date/time, headcount, required certs, priority)
2. System generates ranked staff suggestions (checks availability, certs, hour limits, overlaps, dept scope)
3. Manager reviews suggestions with explanations
4. Manager confirms assignment (or system auto-assigns if enabled)
5. System validates eligibility — shows warnings for issues
6. If warning: Manager can override with recorded reason (or blocked if strict rule)
7. Staff receives notification → task appears in their list
8. Staff clocks in → works → clocks out → marks completed

### 7.3 Staff Withdrawal Flow

1. Staff requests withdrawal with required reason
2. System notifies Manager
3. Manager reviews and reassigns if needed

### 7.4 Eligibility Check Factors

- **Availability**: Is staff available during the task time slot?
- **Certifications**: Does staff have the required verified certifications?
- **Hour Limits**: Would this task push staff over their weekly/daily limit?
- **Task Overlap**: Does staff have another task at the same time?
- **Department Scope**: Is staff assigned to the task's department?

---

## 8. Constraints and Assumptions

### Assumptions
- Organizations use departments for structure
- Each org operates as a separate isolated tenant
- Managers confirm task assignments (unless auto-assign is enabled)
- Staff maintain their own availability
- Only verified certifications count toward eligibility
- Users access the system online (web only)

### Constraints
- Web application only (no native mobile)
- Stripe sandbox only (no real payments)
- One-way calendar support only
- No payroll, HR management, or enterprise compliance
- FYP timeline limits scope

---

## 9. Out of Scope

- Native mobile applications
- Payroll processing
- Two-way calendar synchronization
- Enterprise-level compliance certification
- Full HR management features
- Live commercial payment processing
- Advanced billing automation (recurring billing, invoices, refunds, tax, proration)

---

## 10. Development Phases

| Phase | Focus |

| 4 | Task management |
| 5 | Eligibility engine + staff suggestions |
| 6 | Task allocation + staff workflow (assign, withdraw, clock, complete) |
