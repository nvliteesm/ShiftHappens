/**
 * Industry Templates Configuration
 *
 * Single source of truth for onboarding templates.
 * Each template defines departments, work rules, and suggested
 * certifications for a specific industry.
 *
 * Used by: onboarding page (template selector + preview),
 * organization service (applies template after org creation).
 *
 * Template application bypasses subscription tier limits —
 * it's initialization, not a regular user action.
 * After setup, all further additions are subject to tier limits.
