 * Fallback Staff Ranker (Control Layer)
 * 
 * Algorithmic staff ranking used when all AI providers fail.

 * 
 * 1. Hours utilization (30%) — fewer hours worked = higher score
 * 2. Availability fit (25%) — tighter schedule match = higher score
 * 3. Certifications (25%) — more relevant certs = higher score
 * 4. Department experience (20%) — more experience = higher score
 * 
 * This ensures the system provides intelligent recommendations
